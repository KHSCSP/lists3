print("\n---- part 1, 20 items ----")
# 1) create any list with at least 20 items
# 2) print the message "the first 3 items are:" then use slicing to print the first 3 items
# 3) print the message "3 items near the middle are:" then use slicing to display those items
# 4) print the message "the last 3 items are:" then display those items
print("the first 3 items are:")
print("the last 3 items are:")

In the United States of America, telephone numbers 
within an area code consist of seven digits. 
The prefix number is the first three digits and 
the line number is the last four digits. 
Traditionally, the prefix number 555 has been used
to provide directory information and assistance.
For this problem, write a program that determines if
 a supplied seven-digit telephone number should be routed to the directory information operator, that is, the prefix number is 555.

Great scientific discoveries are often named 
by the last names of scientists that made them. 
For example, the most popular asymmetric cryptography system, RSA was discovered by Rivest, Shamir and Adleman. Another notable example is the Knuth-Morris-Pratt algorithm, named by Knuth, Morris and Pratt.
Scientific papers reference earlier works a lot 
and itâ€™s not uncommon for one document to use 
two different naming conventions: 
the short variation (e.g. KMP) using only the first letters of authors last names 
and the long variation (e.g. Knuth-Morris-Pratt) using complete last names separated by hyphens.
We find mixing two conventions in one paper to be 
aesthetically unpleasing and would like you to write
a program that will transform long variations 
into short.
